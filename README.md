# KNN_project
In this project I used the K Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the security status of cars. 
There are six parameters in the dataset including:

the buying price of the car (vhigh - low), 
the maintenance fee of the car (vhigh - low)
number of doors (2-5 or more)
number of persons (2,4,more)
the size of luggage boot ï¼ˆsmall-big)
and the estimated safety of the car (low-high)

The process inludes converting the raw data (with non-numerical values) into numerical ones using Label_Encoder()
and use the normal KNN algorithm.

A special thanks to Tech_with_Tim, who inspired me to carry out the project and his videos on machine learning
in general helps me a lot.
